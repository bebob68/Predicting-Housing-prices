# Predicting-Housing-prices
Housing prices in iowa are predicted by using random forest reggressor.
I have used public Data on Housing prices in Iowa to predict them. By just giving the properties of the house such as number of hoiuses 
Location, sq foot etc
the model developed can predict with high accuracy
